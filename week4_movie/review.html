      <h2> REVIEW of The Movie <em>Good Will Hunting</em> (1997)</h2>


      <p><b>Idrees M. Abdurrazzak</b> Feburary 1, 2024</p>
      
      <p><i>
      Good Will Hunting, is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. Being based in New England is defiently a factor, however, the deeper elements within the film is what resonates with me. Will is a young man from the streets of <i>"Southie"</i>, who to the surpise of many is a genius. His enviorment was caging in his potential, something Professor Maguire was trying to help him escape. Will seems like the typical stereotype, which is conviently uses as his cover. Under his cool exterior lies a troubled soul that is slowly succuming to his demons. Through therapy and geunine care from his surroundings, Will realizes he must take advantage of his opportunities, that not just <i><b>any</b></i> kid from south Boston recieves. 

        I enjoyed this film due to its psycological, humorous a relatable elements. Matt Damon & Ben Affleck surley hit a chord with this one.

            <h3>Trivia for <em>Good Will Hunting</em></h3>

           
              <ol>
                <li><p>In 2014, after Robin Williams died, the bench in the Boston Public Garden where he and Matt Damon had their conversation scene became an impromptu memorial site. People left flowers, quotes, and various items at the bench. A petition has been passed around to erect a statue in Williams' memory near the bench.</p></li>

                <li><p>On the first day of the shooting, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck started crying out of happiness, because it was a scene between Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgård, accomplished actors, doing Damon's and Affleck's scene verbatim, and they had waited five years for it to happen.</p></li>

                <li><p>The phone number printed on the sign for the construction company that they are working for is the actual phone number of a Woburn, Massachusetts construction company that Matt Damon worked for while going to high school in Cambridge.</p></li>
